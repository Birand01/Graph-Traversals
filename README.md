# Graph-Traversals

This program implements both BFT and DFT algorithms to traverse a given graph.
It takes a char input from the user to set the destination vertex and prints out two paths from the starting
vertex “A” to the given destination: One found with BFS algorithm and the other with DFS. For the
example graph given in this manual, if the user enters Vertex “E” as the destination, the
output of BFS should be “A C E” while the output of DFS should be “A B C E”.
